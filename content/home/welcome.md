We are Materials Theory and Simulation Group, and are broadly interested in:

* Quantum ab-initio theory for real  materials
* Machine Learning and material database generation
* Topological phase of insulators and metals
* MXene: non van der Waal two-dimensional material
* Physics and chemistry of hydrogen interactions with materials
* Hydrogen generation and storage
* Mechanical, structural, electronic, and magnetic, properties of nanostructures including graphene, nanowires, nanotubes, and nanoclusters
* Theory of  defects, impurities, doping and diffusion in bulk and reduced dimensional systems
* Thermal and electrical transport
* Quasiparticle and optical excitations
